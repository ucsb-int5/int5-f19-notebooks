    "### The Monty Hall Problem ###\n",
    "This [problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) has flummoxed many people over the years, [mathematicians included](https://web.archive.org/web/20140413131827/http://www.decisionsciences.org/DecisionLine/Vol30/30_1/vazs30_1.pdf). Let's see if we can work it out by simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The setting is derived from a television game show called \"Let's Make a Deal\". Monty Hall hosted this show in the 1960's, and it has since led to a number of spin-offs. An exciting part of the show was that while the contestants had the chance to win great prizes, they might instead end up with \"zonks\" that were less desirable. This is the basis for what is now known as *the Monty Hall problem*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The setting is a game show in which the contestant is faced with three closed doors. Behind one of the doors is a fancy car, and behind each of the other two there is a goat. The contestant doesn't know where the car is, and has to attempt to find it under the following rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The contestant makes an initial choice, but that door isn't opened.\n",
    "- At least one of the other two doors must have a goat behind it. Monty opens one of these doors to reveal a goat, displayed in all its glory in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem).\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are two doors left, one of which was the contestant's original choice. One of the doors has the car behind it, and the other one has a goat. The contestant now gets to choose which of the two doors to open.\n",
    "\n",
    "The contestant has a decision to make. Which door should they choose to open, if they want the car? Should they stick with their initial choice, or switch to the other door? That is the Monty Hall problem."

    "\n",
    "The solution to the problem is quite straightforward under this assumption, though the straightforward solution doesn't convince everyone. Here it is anyway.\n",

    "- The chance that the car is behind one of the other doors is 2/3.\n",
    "- Even after one of the doors is opened, the car is behind either the originally chosen door or the door that remains. It can't be anywhere else.\n",
    "- Therefore, the chance that the car is behind the door that remains is 2/3.\n",
    "- Therefore, the contestant should switch.\n",
