EV is essentially an average, except that EV takes into account the probability of getting each value.

    "\n",

    "* $3/8$ for one head (3 outcomes contain exactly one head in three tosses), \n",
    "* $3/8$ for two heads, and \n",
    "* $1/8$ for 3 heads (three heads in three coin flips can happen in exactly one way).\n",
